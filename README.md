## ü§î Why This Guide?

I faced several challenges while setting up my device for YOLO-based real-time object detection. The lack of accurate guidelines from official sources, even on NVIDIA forums, made it a time-consuming process. Here's a streamlined guide based on my experience to save you the hassle.

## üõ† Steps to Install PyTorch and TorchVision

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites
Update your system and install required dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev
```
Set up a Python virtual environment (recommended):

python3 -m venv ~/env
source ~/env/bin/activate

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install PyTorch

Download the compatible PyTorch wheel from NVIDIA:

    Visit NVIDIA PyTorch Downloads.
    Select the PyTorch wheel for JetPack 6.1:
        Example file: torch-2.5.0a0+872d972e41.nv24.08-cp310-cp310-linux_aarch64.whl

Install PyTorch:

pip install /path/to/torch-2.5.0a0+872d972e41.nv24.08-cp310-cp310-linux_aarch64.whl

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Build TorchVision from Source

Since NVIDIA doesn‚Äôt provide a prebuilt TorchVision wheel for JetPack 6.1, you‚Äôll need to build it from source.
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/pytorch/vision.git
cd vision

Checkout the Compatible Version:

Make sure the TorchVision version aligns with your PyTorch version:

git checkout tags/v0.20.0

Build and Install TorchVision:

python3 setup.py install

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Ensure you‚Äôve installed dependencies (libjpeg-dev, libpng-dev, libtiff-dev) before building.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Installation

Run this script to confirm the setup:

import torch
import torchvision

print("Torch Version:", torch.__version__)
print("TorchVision Version:", torchvision.__version__)
print("CUDA Available:", torch.cuda.is_available())

if torch.cuda.is_available():
    print("CUDA Device:", torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))

‚úîÔ∏è Expected Output:

    Torch Version: 2.5.0a0+872d972e41.nv24.08
    TorchVision Version: 0.20.0
    CUDA Available: True
    CUDA Device: Orin

## ‚öôÔ∏è Why Build TorchVision from Source?

Building TorchVision from source ensures:

    Compatibility with your specific PyTorch version.
    Flexibility to customize or optimize for your needs.

## üêõ Troubleshooting
Common Issues:

    Version Mismatch:
        Verify TorchVision matches your installed PyTorch version.
        Use git checkout to get the correct version from GitHub.

    Missing Dependencies:
        Ensure dependencies like libjpeg-dev, libpng-dev, and libtiff-dev are installed:

    sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev

Build Errors:

    Update setuptools and pip:

        pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

## üéâ Conclusion

Follow this guide to efficiently set up PyTorch and TorchVision on JetPack 6.1, leveraging the full potential of NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX for AI/ML projects. Save and share this guide with others to streamline their setup process. Happy coding! üöÄ
